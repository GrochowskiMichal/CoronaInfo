Native application project aimed at supporting the difficult global situation related to coronavirus.

In the application you will find reliable, official information on the current situation related to the coronavirus pandemic. 
You can learn how to take precautions and what to do in the event of suspected infection in yourself or your loved ones.

The project is a typical information application. It consists of many different tabs - FAQ on the pandemic situation, covid statistics in Poland and in the world, news articles and a "rapid response algorithm" providing informations depending on the pandemic situation of the user.


<b>The project is made for self-development purposes.</b>

## Detailed description of application tabs
### Country (Poland) statistics section
The project contains directly scraped government data (ministry of health) on the number of infections and covid hospitals.
The data is properly parsed and presented in a graphical system that is easy to view. The legal issue regarding the use of data and resources from the Ministry of Health was agreed with it directly.

<h3> Rapid response algorithm section </h3>
Based on the data obtained by WHO, a special "rapid response" system has also been created, allowing for that time to make appropriate decisions in connection with the pandemic situation in which the user is specifically located.

System - the form consists of a dozen or so different scenarios dressed in a grid of questions regarding the procedure in relation to a specific situation, which finally directs to the last tabs presenting:
* detailed information
* links to WHO or government websites
* direct phonecall functional buttons to the appropriate support numbers
* etc.

<h3> Detailed statistics graphs section </h3>
In collaboration with Marcin Mnich and Micha≈Ç Rogalski, with their permission, I have added to the seperate tab, their covid report to my application using proper parsing and web-view component.

Report is based on data from the ministry of health and voivodship self-governments showing accurate and highly detailed math data and predictions for covid-19 status.
